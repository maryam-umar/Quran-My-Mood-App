How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, SQL & Python.

This is my first project so README's are new to me. However, I had so much fun building this. The front-end is deployed on Github Pages whereas the backend is deployed on
PythonAnywhere. Alot of the advice I got was creating something I loved as my projects so this was a passion project as well as a learning on the job.


Lessons Learned:
Going into this project I knew all teh tech I wanted to use to demonstrate my ability as a data scientist. I learnt the following:
1. No matter how much you've studied in theory, you need to be adaptable in practice.
2. Python is amazing (LMAO!)
3. Always take a stepback when it gets stressful and come back to the table with a clear headspace, it definitely makes a world of difference.
4. Build things you love in line with skills you want to learn.
