## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SQL & Python.

This is my first project, so READMEs are new to me. However, I had so much fun building this. The front-end is deployed on GitHub Pages, whereas the backend is deployed on PythonAnywhere. A lot of the advice I got was to create something I loved for my projects, so this was both a passion project and a learning experience.

## Lessons Learned

Going into this project, I knew all the tech I wanted to use to demonstrate my ability as a data scientist. I learned the following:
1. No matter how much you've studied in theory, you need to be adaptable in practice.
2. Python is amazing (LMAO!).
3. Always take a step back when it gets stressful and come back to the table with a clear headspace; it definitely makes a world of difference.
4. Build things you love in line with the skills you want to learn.
